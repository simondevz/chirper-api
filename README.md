# chirper-api
The API for the Chirper web app, a Twitter clone application, encompasses the backend functionality and endpoints that enable communication and interaction with the server. It serves as the bridge between the Chirper app's frontend and the server, facilitating actions and features within the application.

When finished the Chirper API will authentication endpoints for user registration, login, and logout, as well as user profile management endpoints for updating information and handling avatars. It also incorporates chirp-related endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting chirps, as well as performing actions like liking or retweeting them.

It will also manage followers and following relationships.

So far I have been able to accomplish the following
1. user autentication
2. user registration
3. chirping(tweeting)
4. re-chirping
5. quote chirping
6. commenting
7. thread generstion

And i have layed the foundations to enable many other features. 

P.S If you are familiar with my [fake twitter repo](https://github.com/simondevz/fake-twitter-app) this is an exact replica if the backend the frontend is over at [chirper](https://github.com/simondevz/chirper).
